This is the github repository for The Graduate Cylinder. 

The site is written in Hugo and hosted on Netlify. Whenever a change is committed to this repo, Netlify will automatically rebuild the website and do the rest of the work for you.

If you would like to contribute your own content, please create a folder for your article in the content/posts folder. The title of this folder will be the URL of your article. Then copy an index.md file from any of the existing posts (in their folders) and change the headers and content. Make sure to save this in your new folder. Once you push this commit to github, the rest of the work will be done for you. 

In step form: 

1. Create folder in the content/posts/ directory, and name it the title of your article (or whatever you want the url to be)

2. Copy an index.md file from any of the other articles into your new folder. 

3. In that new copied file, change the headers and body text to add your content. 

4. If you want to add a photo, put that in the same folder.

5. Commit to github.
