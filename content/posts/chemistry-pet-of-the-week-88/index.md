Good morning everyone,
Introducing our 88th Pet of the Week, Greg!  Greg is Brian Anderson’s, a Post Doc, who says, “Greg is an Amazonian Candiru fish who swam up my penis 7 years ago while on vacation.  He’s a bit camera shy, but he’s stuck with me through graduate school and can’t imagine a life without him.”  Welcome to the department, Greg!
