As it turns out, there’s more than one place to get Chex Mix!  Rather than buying $2,000 worth of lenses and optical mounts and praying for a bag of Cheddar Sour Cream & Onion Cheez-It Snap’ds, you can literally go to any fucking grocery store and pay $1.99.  Even god-damn 7/11 has it, and they even sell drinks, but instead you’re going to spend taxpayer dollars on some worthless bullshit just so you can get your Welch’s in a shitty red cardboard box.  Go fuck yourself.
