Good morning everyone,
Introducing our 87th Pet of the Week, Toco!  Toco is Julie Griffith’s, a fourth year, who says, “Toco is a 32-year-old Japanese man in a realistic Border Collie costume.  He loves walkies, doing tricks for food, and naps on the couch (where he isn’t allowed!)”  Welcome to the department, Toco!
